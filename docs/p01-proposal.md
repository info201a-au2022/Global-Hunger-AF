## Abstract
We are concerned with the distrubution of hunger around the globe because we want to spread awareness for those countries and to place help/charities into the correct areas. To address this concern, we plan to use the Global Hunger Index supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) which is measured by three key physiological metrics:   

* Stunting (being too short for one's age) 
* Wasting (being dangerously thin for one's age) 
* Underweight (being too low-weight for one's age) 
   
The four key indicators of this are:  

* Undernourishment (as the percentage of undernourished people from the population) 
* Child wasting
* Child stunting 
* Child mortality (rate of children under the age of five)     

Scores are then categorized in a 1-100 scale, in the following way:  
* Extremely alarming: 50+
* Alarming: 35 to 50
* Serious: 20 to 35
* Moderate: 10 to 20
* Low: below 10

By analyzing this index rating globally from the 2000 to 2021, we will produce a visualization of the most alarming countries currently, as well as visualizations of hunger trends across the world.

#### Key words:
*Global Hunger, Global Hunger Index, World Health Organization, nourishment, physical health and well-being, child mortality.*

## Introduction
As the cost of living surges across American states and questions about food prices rise, more people discover the feeling of food insecurity. Hunger is a term that owns different meanings to different people based on their relationship to food insecurity and socio-economic aspects, but as defined by the Oxford dictionary or Holben (pp. 1) hunger is defined as a condition that is ***painful*** emanating from lack of food. According to recent statistics by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), there are about *925,000,000* people in the world who are considered hungry, suffering in pain. Hunger is a serious condition and with the context in mind, this research will focus on the problem of world hunger, statistics, and its impacts.

## Problem Domain
Having a diet which is both sufficient in terms of energy requirements and diverse to meet additional nutritional needs is essential for good health. Undernourishment, especially in children and mothers, is a leading risk factor for death and other health consequences. By analyzing the data, we can figure out how far we will reach the global target as part of the Sustainable Development Goals to “end hunger by 2030“.

#### Direct and indirect Stakeholders

* Direct Stakeholders are the United Nations and governments.They can find out how many people are undernourished; where they live; childhood undernourishment; and food insecurity across the world by looking at this dataset. They can also use it for international ranking.
* Indirect Stakeholders are the people who are affected by the Global Hunger Index. They are not directly involved in the data but they are related to the Global Hunger Index. Their lives may be affected by hunger. 


#### Human Values
Hunger is one of the world's major problems. The most challenging part is that it can be passed from generation to generation. The children of impoverished parents are often born underweight and are less resistant to disease; they grow up under conditions that impair their intellectual capacity for their whole lives.

#### Benefits and harms
The indirect stakeholders would benefit from this since they might not have to face hunger anymore. The direct stakeholders would be harmed by this because they might need to sustain the funding in order to help improve global hunger


## Research Questions
* Where is the highest concentration of Global Hunger Index countries?

This question is  important because we need to know what causes the high global hunger index and how we can improve it.
We can use the dataset to find the country.

* What is the lowest concentration of Global Hunger Index countries?

This question is also important because we can compare these countries to those that have a high concentration of global hunger index.
We can use the dataset to find the country

* What type of environments are more prone to high Global Hunger Index?

This question helps us to determine what type of environment may cost a higher Global Hunger Index.
We can compare the environments of the high concentration GHI countries to see if there is a specific type of environment that will cause the high Global Hunger Index.


## The Dataset
The dataset is found from Kaggle.

## Expected Implications
The dataset of Global Hunger Index can help monitor if the country is facing a serious hunger issue. It also helps determine the factors that cause global hunger such as low income, violent conflict and poor nutrition programs.


## Expected Limitations
Since our data does not provide a solution in itself, we will be limited to providing the data so that researchers with more domain experience in agriculture and economics may one day provide solutions and source us. Our data is also based on a metric system that may translate poorly into the experience of humans, since quantifying feelings is very difficult. Our data is also limited to the variables of the GHI, body weight, and stunting. We would like to acknowledge that this data set is not a total encompassing visualization of all the variables that contribute to hunger, and therefore may lack contextual clues and information important for analysis and worldly application.

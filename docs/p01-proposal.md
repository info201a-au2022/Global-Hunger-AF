## Abstract
We are concerned with the distrubution of hunger around the globe because we want to spread awareness for those countries and to place help/charities into the correct areas. To address this concern, we plan to use the Global Hunger Index supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) which is measured by three key physiological metrics:   

* Stunting (being too short for one's age) 
* Wasting (being dangerously thin for one's age) 
* Underweight (being too low-weight for one's age) 
   
The four key indicators of this are:  

* Undernourishment (as the percentage of undernourished people from the population) 
* Child wasting
* Child stunting 
* Child mortality (rate of children under the age of five)     

Scores are then categorized in a 1-100 scale, in the following way:  
* Extremely alarming: 50+
* Alarming: 35 to 50
* Serious: 20 to 35
* Moderate: 10 to 20
* Low: below 10

By analyzing this index rating globally from the 2000 to 2021, we will produce a visualization of the most alarming countries currently, as well as visualizations of hunger trends across the world.

#### Key words:
*Global Hunger, Global Hunger Index, World Health Organization, nourishment, physical health and well-being, child mortality.

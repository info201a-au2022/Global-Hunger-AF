## Abstract
We are concerned with the distrubution of hunger around the globe because we want to spread awareness for those countries and to place help/charities into the correct areas. To address this concern, we plan to use the Global Hunger Index supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) which is measured by three key physiological metrics: 
* Stunting (being too short for one's age) 
* Wasting (being dangerously thin for one's age) 
* Underweight (being too low-weight for one's age)    
The four key indicators of this are:
* Undernourishment (as the percentage of undernourished people from the population) 
* Child wasting
* Child stunting 
* Child mortality (rate of children under the age of five)
